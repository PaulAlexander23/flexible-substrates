# Flexible substrates

This repository contains the code to generate the data used in the paper ().

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Matlab 

### Usage

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## All functions

### compute_c_switchboard.m
### compute_long_wave.m
### compute_OS_eigs.m
### compute_phi.m
### compute_zero_reynolds.m
### contour_single.m
### plot_dispersion_relation.m
### plot_neutral_curve.m
### plot_phase_speed.m
